# Logical operators = evaluate multiple conditions ( or, and , not)
#   or = at least one condition must be true
#   and = both conditions must be true
#   not = inverts the condition (not False, not True)

#   Conditional expression = A one-line shortcut for the if-else statement (ternary operator)
#            print or assign one of two values based on a condition
#           x if condition else Y

num = 5
# print("positive" if num > 0 else "negative") # Positive
# result = "Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "ODD"
# print(result)
